\section{PCB Coils}
The biggest problem with standard coils is their size, especially in the z-direction as the more windings are used the thicker they will become. This is a problem for applications where space is limited, such as in the case of implantable devices. To address this issue, researchers have started to experiment with creating coil windings using PCB technology. This allows for the creation of coils that are thinner and more compact than traditional coils. In this section, we will discuss the different types of PCB coils and the challenges associated with their miniaturization.
