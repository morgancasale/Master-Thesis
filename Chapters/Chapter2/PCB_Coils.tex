\section{PCB Coils}
The \textbf{biggest problem with standard coils is their size}, especially in the z-direction as the more windings are used the thicker they will become. This is a problem for applications where space is limited, such as in the case of implantable devices. To address this issue, researchers have started to experiment with \textbf{creating coil windings using PCB technology}. This allows for the creation of \textbf{coils} that are \textbf{thinner} and \textbf{more compact} than traditional coils. In this section, we will discuss the different types of PCB coils and the challenges associated with their miniaturization.
