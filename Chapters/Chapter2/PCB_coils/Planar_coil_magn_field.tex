\subsection{Planar coil magnetic field}
The structure of a planar coil is very different from a standard one, as it is a flat structure with a spiral winding. The magnetic field generated by a planar coil is more complex than that of a standard coil, as the \textbf{magnetic field is not concentrated in the center} of the coil but is distributed over the entire surface of the coil. This makes the magnetic field generated by a planar coil more difficult to calculate than that of a standard coil.

    An open-closed equation is difficult to derive so, usually, the equation for the magnetic field generated by a coil on its surface is simplified as:

    \begin{equation}
        Bz = \frac{\mu N I}{2} \cdot \frac{\ln(\frac{b}{a})}{b-a} % https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bp9gGCSLc4 TODO: find a reference
        \label{eq: Spiral_magn_field_eq}
    \end{equation}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Bz$ is the magnetic field on the z-axis [T]
        \item $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability of the medium [H/m]
        \item $N$ is the number of turns of the spiral
        \item $I$ is the current flowing through the wire [A]
        \item $b$ is the external radius of the spiral [m]
        \item $a$ is the internal radius of the spiral [m]
    \end{itemize}

    To then find the magnetic field at a distance $z$ from the center of the coil, we can use the equation \ref{eq: Coil_magn_field} from the previous subsection and substitute the radius $r$ of the coil with
    \nopagebreak  

    \begin{equation}
        r' = \frac{b-a}{\ln\frac{b}{a}} \rightarrow B_z = \frac{\mu N I r'^2}{2(r'^2+z^2)^\frac{3}{2}} 
        \label{eq: Spiral_magn_field_dist}
    \end{equation}
    \nopagebreak

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $r'$ is the average radius of the spiral [m]
        \item $z$ is the distance on the z-axis from the center of the coil [m]
    \end{itemize}
