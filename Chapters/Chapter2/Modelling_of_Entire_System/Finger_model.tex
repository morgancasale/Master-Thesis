\subsection{Finger grasping model}
At last, we have also to model the finger grasping the device, we can derive the model from the one used in \cite{Finger_grasping_model} for the human finger.

    }
    \caption{Model of two soft fingers grasping the object.}
    \label{fig:Finger grasping model}
\end{figure}

This model describes two fingers grasping an object, for our case, we can simplify it to a single finger grasping the device.
Also, we can neglect the friction between the finger and the device as the device will be tested positioned on a flat surface with only the finger touching it from above.
