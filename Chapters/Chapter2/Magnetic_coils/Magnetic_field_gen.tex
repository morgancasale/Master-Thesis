  The strength of the magnetic field on the z-axis of the coil is derived from the Biot-Savart Law and is given by the formula
  \nopagebreak

  \begin{equation}
    B_z=\frac{N\mu Ir^2}{2(r^2+z^2)^\frac{3}{2}} 
    \label{eq: Coil_magn_field}
  \end{equation}
  \nopagebreak

  Where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \( B_z \) is the magnetic field on the z-axis [T].
    \item \( \mu \) is the magnetic permeability of the medium [H/m].
    \item \( I \) is the current flowing through the wire [A].
    \item \( r \) is the radius of the coil [m].
    \item \( N \) is the number of turns of wire in the coil.
    \item \( z \) is the z-distance from the center of the coil [m].
  \end{itemize}
\end{samepage}

Usually, coils are paired with a core material to increase the magnetic field intensity;
in that case, instead of the permeability of air, the permeability of the core is calculated as
\[\mu = \mu_0 \cdot \mu_r\]
where \( \mu_r \) is the relative permeability of the core material.

With the right material for the core, the magnetic field intensity can be highly increased compared to the field generated by the coil alone.

  \subsubsection{Magnetic Flux and Field relation}
  \nopagebreak

  We can also relate the magnetic field to the magnetic flux generated by the coil. The magnetic flux is given by the formula
  \nopagebreak

  \begin{equation*}
    \Phi_B=B \cdot A \label{eq: Magnetic_flux_&_field}
  \end{equation*}
  \nopagebreak

  Where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \( \Phi_B \) is the magnetic flux [Wb].
    \item \( B \) is the magnetic field [T].
    \item \( A \) is the area of the coil [m\(^2\)].
  \end{itemize}
