\subsection{Pros of flexible coils}
Flexible PCBs offer several advantages over traditional rigid PCBs, we can list some of the key pros of flexible PCBs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Flexibility and Space Savings}: Flexible PCBs can bend and twist, allowing for \textbf{compact} and \textbf{efficient use of space} in electronic devices.
    
    \item \textbf{Lightweight}: The materials used in flexible PCBs are \textbf{lightweight}, making them ideal for applications where weight is a concern, such as in aerospace or portable electronics.
    
    \item \textbf{Improved Design Freedom}: Flex PCBs allow for more creative and versatile designs because they can be \textbf{formed into complex shapes} and \textbf{fit} into \textbf{tight} or \textbf{irregular spaces}.
    
    \item \textbf{Reduced Connectors and Interconnects}: Because flexible PCBs can bend, they can often \textbf{eliminate} the \textbf{need} for \textbf{additional connectors and interconnects}, reducing overall system complexity.
    
    \item \textbf{Vibration and Shock Resistance}: Flexible PCBs can \textbf{absorb shock} and \textbf{vibrations better than rigid PCBs}, making them suitable for use in environments where these are concerns.

    \item \textbf{Simplified Assembly}: With fewer connectors and interconnects, assembly becomes easier and faster, reducing labor and potential points of failure.
