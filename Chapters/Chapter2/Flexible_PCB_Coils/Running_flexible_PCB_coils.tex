\subsection{Running flexible PCB coils}

\subsubsection{High current needs}
As discussed in the previous paragraph flexible coils have very high resistance so to produce even low magnetic fields high current must be provided.
Considering the power limit of the Flexar coil $P_{max} = 0.8W$ we can calculate the maximum current that can be provided to the coil with \ref{eq:Joule_heating} as
\begin{equation}
    I = \sqrt{\frac{P_{max}}{R}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.8}{30}} = 0.1633A
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Constant Voltage vs Constant Current power supplying}
To power our coil we have two options, we can either provide a constant voltage or a constant current.
Using a constant current source is not advisable due to the heating problem of the coil, at high currents as the coil is run it will heat up and its resistance will increase which will cause the power source to increase the voltage to keep the current constant.
This in turn will cause the coil to heat up even more and the cycle will continue until the coil is damaged.

Instead, using a constant voltage source as the resistance increases due to the coil exceeding the heating and power threshold we will only have a decrease in the current which results in a loss of magnetic field strength but the coil won't get damaged.
