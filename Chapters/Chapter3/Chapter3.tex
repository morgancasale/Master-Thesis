\label{Chapter3}

Computer Haptic Feedback or Haptics, in short, is the research field that deals with the need to be able to digitalize the human sense of touch and reproduce it. Despite the research done in this field since the mid-20\textsuperscript{th} century, the technology is still in its infancy. The main reason for this is the complexity of the human sense of touch which we still don't understand fully.
This, in turn, doesn't allow us to even approximately match the capabilities of the human sense of touch; but we can still use this infant technology to reproduce simple sensations.
This sensation can be used in many fields, from the entertainment industry to the medical field, from the military to the automotive industry to convey information that we do not normally acquire via touch, such as notifications
and warnings related to particular events, guidance instructions, and even crude reproduction of textures.
In this chapter, we will give an overview of the human sense of touch and the state of art technologies used to reproduce it.
