\subsection{Dresda coils}
The technology the HZDR team used to produce their coil is based on circuit inkjet printing.
Circuit inkjet printing consists of using a printer to deposit conductive ink on a substrate.
In this application, they used a flexible substrate to print the coil to allow it to be bent.
After printing the conductive ink is tinned to improve the conductivity of the coil and allow it to be soldered to other components.

\subsubsection{Low resistance and high power needs}
The Dresden coils have a \textbf{resistance} of about \textbf{2$\Omega$}, \textbf{external radius} of \textbf{5e-3m}, \textbf{internal} one of \textbf{0.84*e-3m}, and \textbf{number of spires} equal to \textbf{11}.
We also know from the HZDR test that the coil can handle up to about \textbf{500mA} before starting to release too much heat.
This means a power limit of about \textbf{0.5W} for the coil.

The current limit is due to the very low resistance of the coil as due to this limitation, for low applied voltages the coil will produce a lot of heat due to the Joule effect \ref{subsubsec: Joule_effect}.

\end{figure}
As we can see in figure \ref{fig: Dresden_heat_graph}, after 1V the power limit is already reached.

\subsubsection{Low magnetic field strength}
For the same reason as the power limit, the magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil is very low.
Using the equation \ref{eq:Spiral_magn_field_eq} we can calculate the magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil on its surface and plot it as a function of the voltage applied to the coil.

    \caption{Magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil}
    \label{fig: Dresden_magnetic_field}
\end{figure}

As we can see in figure \ref{fig: Dresden_magnetic_field}, even at the power limit, the magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil is very low (in the order of 1mT).

\subsubsection{Fragility and low flexibility}
The Dresden coil is produced by using three layers of different materials.
The first layer is the substrate, which is made of a material similar to paper, the second layer is the conductive ink, and the third layer is the tinning.
The substrate is not very flexible, and neither is the tinning;
this makes the spires of the coil easily damageable if bent repeatedly.
Also, the tinning gets cracked by repeatedly heating and cooling the coil, which constantly happens during the coil's use.
The tinning cracking would happen multiple times during our tests, and we would have to re-tin the damaged parts of the coil to keep using it.
