\subsection{Dresda coils}
The technology the HZDR team used to produce their coil is based on \textbf{circuit inkjet printing}.
Circuit inkjet printing consists of using a printer to \textbf{deposit conductive ink} on a substrate.
In this application, they used a \textbf{flexible substrate} to print the coil to allow it to be bent.

\begin{samepage}
    After printing the conductive ink is \textbf{tinned} to improve the conductivity of the coil and allow it to be soldered to other components.

\subsubsection{Low resistance and high power needs}
The Dresden coils have a resistance of about \textbf{2$\Omega$}, the external radius of \textbf{5e-3m}, the internal one of \textbf{0.84*e-3m}, and the number of spires equal to \textbf{11}.
We also know from the HZDR test that the coil can handle up to about \textbf{500mA} before starting to release too much heat.
This means a power limit of about \textbf{0.5W} for the coil.

\begin{samepage}
    The current limit is due to the \textbf{very low resistance} of the coil as for low applied voltages the coil will produce a lot of heat due to the \textbf{Joule effect} \ref{subsubsec: Joule_effect}.

        \label{fig: Dresden_heat_graph}
    \end{figure}
    As we can see in figure \ref{fig: Dresden_heat_graph}, after 1V the power limit is already reached.
\end{samepage}


\subsubsection{Low magnetic field strength}
For the same reason as the power limit, the magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil is \textbf{very low}.
Using the equation \ref{eq: Spiral_magn_field_eq} we can calculate the magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil on its surface and plot it as a function of the voltage applied to the coil (Fig. \ref{fig: Dresden_magnetic_field}).

    }
    \caption{Magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil}
    \label{fig: Dresden_magnetic_field}
\end{figure}

As we can see in figure \ref{fig: Dresden_magnetic_field}, even at the power limit, the magnetic field produced by the Dresden coil is very low (in the order of 1mT).

\subsubsection{Fragility and low flexibility}
The Dresden coil is produced by using \textbf{three layers} of different materials.
The first layer is the substrate, which is made of a material similar to \textbf{paper}, the second layer is the \textbf{conductive ink}, and the third layer is the \textbf{tinning}.
The substrate is \textbf{not very flexible}, and neither is the tinning;
this makes the spires of the coil \textbf{easily damageable if bent repeatedly}.
Also, the tinning gets \textbf{cracked} by repeatedly heating and cooling the coil, which constantly happens during the coil's use.
The tinning cracking would happen multiple times during our tests, and we would have to \textbf{re-tin the damaged parts} of the coil to keep using it.
