\section{Flexible Mat Prototypes}
\label{sec: Flexible_Mat_Prototypes}
The goal of these prototypes was to create a small silicone mat where the magnet could be suspended in a membrane integrated into the mat itself.
In this mat, it would be also trapped the coil and its heatsink.
As the mat would be made of silicone, it would allow the device to flex with the flexible coil.
