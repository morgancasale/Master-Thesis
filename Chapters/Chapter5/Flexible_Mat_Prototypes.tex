\section{Flexible Mat Prototypes}
\label{sec: Flexible_Mat_Prototypes}
The goal of these prototypes was to create a small silicone mat where the magnet could be suspended in a membrane \textbf{integrated into the mat} itself.
\textbf{The coil and its heatsink would also be "trapped" inside the mat.}
As the mat would be made of silicone, it would allow the device to \textbf{flex} with the flexible coil.
As we \textbf{can't 3D print silicone} we had to create the entire design to be able to make it by \textbf{silicone casting} taking into account all the design limitations of this method.
All the pieces were designed in SolidWorks and then 3D printed to create the molds for the silicone casting.
