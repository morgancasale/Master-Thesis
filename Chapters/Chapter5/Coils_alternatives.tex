\section{Coils alternatives}
This research was originally born from the willingness to explore the possibility of exploiting the technology of flexible coil inductors by using one produced by the research group Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) in Dresden, Germany \cite{HZDR}.
After testing this coil, we realized its limitations and decided to explore other alternatives.
For our research, we landed on Flexar coils, which as we discussed before are flexible PCB coils produced by the company microbots \cite{microbots}.
In this section, we will compare the Dresden coil with the Flexar coil, which is the one we chose to use in our research.

\subsection{Dresda coils}

\subsubsection{Low magnetic field strenght}

\subsubsection{Fragility and low flexibility}

\subsubsection{Very high resistance and power needs}


% -- Subsection 5.2
\subsection{Flexar coils}

\subsubsection{Higher magnetic field strenght}

\subsubsection{Higher flexibility}

\subsubsection{Lower resistance and power needs}
