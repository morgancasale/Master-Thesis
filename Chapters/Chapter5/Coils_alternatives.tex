\section{Coils alternatives}
This research was originally born from the willingness to explore the possibility of exploiting the technology of flexible coil inductors by using one produced by the research group \textbf{Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf} (HZDR) in Dresden, Germany \cite{HZDR}.
After testing this coil, we realized its \textbf{limitations} and decided to explore other alternatives.

For our research, we landed on \textbf{Flexar coils}, which as we discussed before are flexible PCB coils produced by the company \textbf{microbots} \cite{microbots}.
In this section, we will compare Dresden coils with Flexar ones.
