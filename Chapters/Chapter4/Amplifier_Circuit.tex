\section{Amplifier circuit}
As the Flexar's coil impedance is 30$\Omega$, and the maximum power they can withstand is 0.8W, the power stage must be able to provide a voltage of about \textbf{6V} at a current of \textbf{0.2A}. \\
Such a high current requires the use of a power amplifier, usually an of the shelf audio amplifier could be used in such an application.
Such devices are built to handle only the \textbf{audible frequency range} (20Hz-20kHz), but our actuators must be able to work between \textbf{1Hz and 1kHz} which corresponds to the \textbf{human tactile perception range}. 

A solution is to implement a custom amplifying circuit based on a special type of operational amplifier, the Power OP-AMP.

% -- Subsection 2.1
\subsection{Power Operational Amplifiers}
Power operational amplifiers (power op-amps) are a specialized class of operational amplifiers designed to handle \textbf{higher current} and \textbf{power requirements} than standard op-amps.
While traditional op-amps are primarily used for signal processing and conditioning in low-power applications, power op-amps are essential for \textbf{driving heavy loads}, including motors, speakers, and other devices that require substantial power.

Power op-amps integrate the fundamental principles of conventional op-amps such as high gain, high input impedance, and low output impedance with the ability to deliver higher current and power. 

\begin{samepage}
    These devices are composed of simple op-amp circuits with a \textbf{power stage}, usually a \textbf{power transistor}, connected to the output of the op-amp. The power stage is responsible for delivering the required current to the load, while the op-amp provides the necessary voltage gain and feedback control.

        \label{fig:Power_Op_Amp}
    \end{figure}
\end{samepage}


\subsubsection{Power op-amp characteristics}
Any op-amp that can deliver \textbf{more than 100mA} of current is considered a power op-amp; there exist models that can deliver up to \textbf{10A}.
For our application, we chose a power op-amp that can deliver up to \textbf{1A} of current, as it is more than enough to drive the Flexar's coils for simple AC signals.
Another factor for this decision is the \textbf{high cost} of these components, especially at higher current ratings, due to their \textbf{complexity} and the \textbf{scarcity of requests} for this type of component from the market.

The component we landed on is the \textbf{L272} from STMicroelectronics, this small chip can deliver up to a \textbf{sustained 1A} of current, \textbf{1.5A} of \textbf{peak} current, and can handle a \textbf{maximum supply} voltage of \textbf{28V}.

In dynamic conditions is also to be noted that the L272 has a \textbf{slew rate of $1\frac{V}{\mu s}$} and, a \textbf{gain-bandwidth product} of \textbf{350kHz} \cite{L272}.

\subsubsection{Power dissipation problems}
A big problem with power op-amps is the \textbf{power dissipation}, as they are designed to deliver high current levels, they also dissipate a lot of power, which can lead to \textbf{overheating} and damage to the device. \\
For example, the L272 can handle up to \textbf{145°C} but at only \textbf{5W} it reaches \textbf{75°C}, so a \textbf{heat sink} is required to keep the device at a safe temperature.

\subsection{High Power Voltage Amplifier}
As we specified before we decided to implement a power stage with a gain of 10, starting with the circuit of a simple \textbf{inverting amplifier} (the real gain is -10 but for the sake of our application a wave flipped by 180° is acceptable).

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Inverting amplifier circuit.}
    \label{fig:non-inv_ampl}
\end{figure}

\begin{samepage}
    The gain can be calculated using the following formula:
    \nopagebreak

    \begin{equation}
        A = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = -\frac{R_f}{R_1}
    \end{equation}
    \nopagebreak

    Where:
    \nopagebreak

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $V_{in}$ is the input voltage.
        \item $V_{out}$ is the output voltage.
        \item $R_1$ is the input resistor.
        \item $R_f$ is the feedback resistor.
    \end{itemize}
\end{samepage}

The values of $R_1$ and $R_f$ have been chosen to be 4.7$k\Omega$ and 47$k\Omega$ respectively, as they are \textbf{standard values} and their order is \textbf{big enough} to work with the provided DAC current of \textbf{12mA}.

% -- Subsection 2.3
\subsection{Noise filtering}
While implementing the amplifier circuit, we noticed that the output signal had a lot of \textbf{high-frequency noise}, which was not present in the input signal.

\begin{samepage}
    To solve this problem, we decided to implement a simple \textbf{low-pass filter} adding a capacitor in parallel with the feedback resistor.
    \nopagebreak

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \resizebox{.6\linewidth}{!}{\input{Chapters/Chapter4/Figures/non-inv_ampl_filter.tex}}
        \caption{Inverting amplifier circuit with the low-pass filter.}
        \label{fig:non-inv_ampl_filter}
    \end{figure}
\end{samepage}

\begin{samepage}
    The cutoff frequency of the filter can be calculated using the following formula:
    \nopagebreak

    \begin{equation}
        f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi R_f C_f}
    \end{equation}
    \nopagebreak

    Where:
    \nopagebreak
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f_c$ is the cutoff frequency [Hz].
        \item $R_f$ is the feedback resistor [$Omega$].
        \item $C_f$ is the capacitor in parallel with the feedback resistor [F].
    \end{itemize}
\end{samepage}


We set a \textbf{cutoff frequency} of \textbf{50kHz}, as it is high enough to filter out the noise but low enough to keep the signal intact.
To achieve this, we chose a capacitor of \textbf{680pF}, as it is a standard value and provides a cutoff frequency of 50kHz with the chosen feedback resistor.
