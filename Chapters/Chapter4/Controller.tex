\section{Controller}
The controller in this application has to be a signal generator that can produce a waveform that can be amplified and sent to the coil.
The controller we used for testing is an ESP32 microcontroller.
We chose this controller as the first test hardware for its simplicity of programming and its integrated DAC.

% -- Subsection 4.1
\subsection{ESP32 DAC Characteristics}
The DAC included in the ESP32 is a pretty basic one but as a first test, it is enough.
The DAC has a resolution of 8 bits, and it can output a voltage between 0 and 3.3V.
It can output max to a sinusoidal wave of 250kHz, but the signal is very noisy.
